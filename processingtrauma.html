    <h2>1. Safety First 🛑</h2>
    <blockquote>“You cannot heal in the same environment where you were hurt.”</blockquote>
    <p>Before anything else, ensure your physical and emotional safety. Healing starts when your nervous system knows you are out of harm’s way.</p>

    <h2>2. Acknowledgment 🫶</h2>
    <blockquote>“What happened to you matters.”</blockquote>
    <p>Recognize that the trauma occurred. Denial or minimizing can delay healing. Giving yourself permission to acknowledge your pain is a courageous first step.</p>

    <h2>3. Naming Emotions 🌊</h2>
    <blockquote>“Feelings that are not felt don’t just go away.” — Alice Miller</blockquote>
    <p>Processing trauma involves naming the complex emotions it brings—grief, fear, anger, shame. Identifying these helps you relate to them with compassion rather than avoidance.</p>

    <h2>4. Telling the Story (Safely) 📖</h2>
    <blockquote>“Healing begins when the story is told in a safe place.”</blockquote>
    <p>This could be through journaling, therapy, art, or trusted conversations. You decide what, when, and how much to share.</p>

    <h2>5. Reconnecting with the Body 🤍</h2>
    <blockquote>“The body keeps the score.” — Bessel van der Kolk</blockquote>
    <p>Trauma often lives in the body. Gentle practices like breathwork, yoga, grounding, or mindful movement can help you feel present and safe again.</p>

    <h2>6. Reframing & Meaning-Making 🕊️</h2>
    <blockquote>“Your trauma is a chapter, not the whole book.”</blockquote>
    <p>As healing progresses, you may start to integrate the experience into your life narrative. This isn’t about silver linings—it’s about reclaiming your agency and redefining your path.</p>

    <h2>7. Connection & Support 🌱</h2>
    <p>Healing doesn’t happen in isolation. Whether through community, therapy, or friendship, supportive relationships remind us we’re not alone in our journey.</p>
