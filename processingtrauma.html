    </div>

    <h2>1. Safety First </h2>
    <blockquote>‚ÄúYou cannot heal in the same environment where you were hurt.‚Äù</blockquote>
    <p>Before anything else, ensure your physical and emotional safety. Healing starts when your nervous system knows you are out of harm‚Äôs way. Kind of blatantly obvious and easier said than done. Much easier said than done. The truth is that it's often in the midst of trauma that we actually start trying to process it, which is unhelpful and unkind to ourselves. It's only when we are in a safe space and in a safe distance that we can start to get an overview of wwhat's happened and see it with some perspective. But for now, just focus your enery on getting out of that space however you can. If the situation is too overwhelming or too big to change, just focus on one piece of the overall puzzle you can manage. If you have to live with someone who has or does traumatised you, keep as much distance as you can. Even if it's as simple as saying no to a lift to work or school in the morning. Start to get that distance and, incrementally, you'll find that those small changes add up to a much bigger, healthier picture.</p>

    <h2>2. Acknowledgment ü´∂</h2>
    <blockquote>‚ÄúWhat happened to you matters.‚Äù</blockquote>
    <p>Recognize that the trauma occurred. Yucky and painful as this can be, it's a really important step. It's easy to fall back on denial or minimising of the event/s for good reason. Don't rush this process. Denial and minimasation are recgnised coping strategies for a reason. Take your time with this. When you are ready, give yourself permission to acknowledge your pain. This is a big, bold step and a courageous moment. But don't force yourself to get there before you are ready.</p>

    <h2>3. Naming Emotions üåä</h2>
    <blockquote>‚ÄúFeelings that are not felt don‚Äôt just go away.‚Äù ‚Äî Alice Miller</blockquote>
    <p>Processing trauma involves naming the complex emotions it brings‚Äî grief, fear, anger, shame. Identifying these helps you relate to them with compassion rather than avoidance. It can be really difficult to recognise messy, mixed up feelings. They can be like colours smashed up over a canvas creating a great whirl of pigmentation. Try and see if you can recognise even a small portion of the paint. "That's red. That's definitely red. And over here, that purple is a mix of red and blue." Take your time. These are not activities that are one and done. Consider creating a feelings journal. Or print out a feelings wheel to help you recognise more subtle emotions. </p>

    <h2>4. Telling the Story (Safely) üìñ</h2>
    <blockquote>‚ÄúHealing begins when the story is told in a safe place.‚Äù</blockquote>
    <p>This could be through journaling, therapy, art, or trusted conversations. You decide what, when, and how much to share. There is no question that sharing trauma is helpful, but there are so many possibilities for things to go wrong. Maybe you simply don't know anyone eho is going to be supportive and give you the validation that you need. Try writing it down in its ugly truth and see if you you can validate it yourself. "Yes, that really did happen and it happened exactly the way I said it did." Burn the paper if you need to. Rip it to shreds if you need to. But write it down. This might feel really awkward at first. If you just write "fuck you" on the page a thousand times, job done. Try again the next day and see if you don't have more of a coherent narrative this time round. If this feels impossible, start by drawing a picture. Any picture. You might have the disconcerting experience of drawing a something warm and fuzzy like a bunny rabbit and then completely destroying it in red or black. This is totally normal, you're not going crazy. Chuck it out if it makes you feel bad and try again when you're ready. You might be surprised that you actually reach a stage when the bunnies, puppies and flowers stay exactly that.</p>

    <h2>5. Reconnecting with the Body ü§ç</h2>
    <blockquote>‚ÄúThe body keeps the score.‚Äù ‚Äî Bessel van der Kolk</blockquote>
    <p>Trauma often lives in the body. Gentle practices like breathwork, yoga, grounding, or mindful movement can help you feel present and safe again. This is all 100% true, but maybe moving your body feels really gross and triggering. Maybe yoga is the last fucking thing you want to do. That's ok too. Try going for a walk, somewhere safe, without any music or distractions. Just focus on the sound of your feet and the neighbourhood around you. If you have company, awesome, but if you don't, just be your own company. Try and notice, really notice what's around you. If you're in an urban environment, notice the shops - are they boarded up? Are they looking for new employees? Does the local hair salon have some weird doggy/owner spa day thing being advertised? Just try and notice what's going on around you.</p>

    <h2>6. Reframing & Meaning-Making üïäÔ∏è</h2>
    <blockquote>‚ÄúYour trauma is a chapter, not the whole book.‚Äù</blockquote>
    <p>As healing progresses, you may start to integrate the experience into your life narrative. This can be a really painful, but ultimately liberating, process. It can start with thoughts like "yeah, he fucking did that to me...and then she fucking told me I was full of shit...well, they can all get fucked..." and move towards something more nuanced like "That was an awful thing that happened and I was treated really poorly by people that I was meant to be able to trust. But you know what, I responded to that with genuine courage and resilience. I know what I'm made of and I know what I'm worth." The reality is that it is your story, even if you really, really wish it wasn't. This is the part where you can say "wow, there is something really wrong with those people. Why would they behave like that?" and you might even find yourself feeling kind of sorry for them that they don't know any better.</p>

    <h2>7. Connection & Support üå±</h2>
    <p>Healing doesn‚Äôt happen in isolation. Whether through community, therapy, or friendship, supportive relationships remind us we‚Äôre not alone in our journey. This is such a big one, and frankly such a hard one for a lot of people. You think, I'm going to find a like minded community and maybe they turn out to be gross or just not your thing. That's ok. Keep up boundaries at first. Take your time to get to know people. Don't feel that you have to force anything. If you already have a strong network that's brilliant. But a lot of us don't and frequently that's how the trauma was allowed to happen in the first place. Try people out. Don't let people trauma dump. If they do, walk away from and try a different space. There are lots of ways to engage in community that have nothing to do with support groups for trauma, and ironically, these can often be the most helpful sources. Think about community broadly. You might find a community of trauma surviors focusing on moving past trauma really helpful. And that's great if it works. But community might look like a regular fun run, a pottery class, a trivia night etc Something that gets you out of the house and meeting people that aren't the dipshits that got you into this mess in the first place. But keep your radar on and back away quicklyif someon gives you even a squeak of a bad vibe.</p>
